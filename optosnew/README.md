# Automated Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning
Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs.Â Retinal (fundus) photography with manual interpretation is a widely accepted screening tool for diabetic retinopathy, with performance that can exceed that of in-person dilated eye examinations.

An automated tool for grading severity of diabetic retinopathy would be very useful for accelerating detection and treatment.

Data contains a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions.

A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4 as shown:

    0 - No DR
    
    1 - Mild
    
    2 - Moderate
    
    3 - Severe
    
    4 - Proliferative DR

Data Source Considerations:

1. There could be noise in both the images and labels. 
2. Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. 
3. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.
